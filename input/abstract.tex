The development of neutrino wakes through interaction with 
dark matter has been shown to produce a dipole term in the 
cross-correlation function between galaxy populations. As 
this dipole distortion would not be present for massless 
neutrinos, it provides a method for determining individual 
neutrino masses. We investigate this technique by calculating 
the dipole correlation function in a large N-body simulation 
using reconstructed velocity fields based on linear theory. 
Additionally, we consider the dipole produced by considering 
velocity fields of neutrino populations binned according to 
their initial energies. We find that at large scales, the dipole 
does not differ significantly between neutrino velocity bins. At 
smaller scales, neutrinos with larger initial velocities produce 
a larger dipole correlation function. The differences between the 
velocity bins is amplified when computing the dipole from velocity 
fields reconstructed using the CDM density field.
