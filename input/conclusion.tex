\begin{section}{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
  We have performed a large N-body simulation containing dark matter
  and 0.2eV neutrinos. We calculated the velocity and density fields
  of neutrinos grouped according to their initial velocities. We found
  that the reuslting dipole correlation function does not differ significantly
  between these neutrino groups at large scales and that at small scales, 
  neutrino groups with greater initial velocities produce greater dipole 
  correlation functions. The effect is enhanced when computing the dipole 
  using velocity fields reconstructed using linear theory from the CDM density 
  field.
