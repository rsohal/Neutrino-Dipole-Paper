  \label{sec:discussion}

  We have calculated the dipole correlation function of neutrinos 
grouped according to their initial velocities using velocity fields
calculated from a momentum method and reconstructed from CDM and halo
density fields. We found that the density and velocity power spectra
of the neutrino bins are consistent with expectations; specifically,
neutrinos with smaller initial velocities have greater density and
velocity power at all scales.
 
\par The differences between the dipole correlation functions 
of the velocity bins were not as great, however. With the 
exception of the dipole of the $Q_1$ velocity bin 
calculated using the CDM linear reconstruction method, there was no significant 
difference between the dipoles of the velocity bins for $r>5\mpch$. 
At smaller scales, the CDM reconstructed velocity fields of 
the larger velocity bins produced the greatest dipole 
correlation functions. This suggests that in computing the 
dipole from observations, it may be advantageous to use the 
velocity fields of neutrinos with greater initial velocities 
in order to increase the signal at small scales.
